# Bank Marketing Campaign Analysis

## Porject Overview

This repository contains the code and report for a school project analyzing the effectiveness of bank marketing campaigns. The goal of the project is to predict if a client will subscribe to a term deposit after a marketing campaign.
The project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature selection, and the application of machine learning models to predict the outcome of bank marketing campaigns. The analysis is based on the "Bank Marketing" dataset.

## Key Tasks

The project is structured around the following key tasks:

1.  **Explain KNN and Naïve Bayes Algorithms:** Explanation of the fundamental concepts of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Naïve Bayes classification algorithms.
2.  **Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Comprehensive exploration of the dataset to understand its characteristics, identify patterns, and gain insights into the variables.
3.  **Feature Selection and Analysis:** Selection of the most relevant features for predicting the target variable, and analysis of their importance.
4.  **Independence Assumption in Naïve Bayes:** Examination of the independence assumption in the Naïve Bayes algorithm and its implications for the dataset.
5.  **Naïve Bayes Model Building and Tuning:** Implementation and optimization of the Naïve Bayes model for predicting campaign outcomes.
6.  **KNN Model Building and Tuning:** Implementation and optimization of the KNN model for predicting campaign outcomes.
7.  **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Model:** Implementation of a Multi-Layer Perceptron neural network model.
8.  **Compare Models:** Comparison of the performance of the Naïve Bayes, KNN, and MLP models.
