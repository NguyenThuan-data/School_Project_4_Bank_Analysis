# Bank Marketing Campaign Analysis

---

## Porject Overview

This repository contains the code and report for a school project analyzing the effectiveness of bank marketing campaigns. The goal of the project is to predict if a client will subscribe to a term deposit after a marketing campaign.
The project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature selection, and the application of machine learning models to predict the outcome of bank marketing campaigns. The analysis is based on the "Bank Marketing" dataset.
